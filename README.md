<!-- Regarding svgr/webpack -->
- .svg files were scraped from the website
- they're html boilerplate that depict a picture.
- I imported that svg file into my react component
- that imported variable is the same thing as another react component.
tutorial below!

1. For example: I import the .svg file like the .jsx file.
  - import BackButton from './backArrow.svg';
  - import Messages from './Universal_Banner-Subcomponents/Messages.jsx';

2. implement both files like subcomponents.
  - <BackButton />
  - <Messages />

3. And Voila!! You know how to implement svg files into your react components.

- The svgr/webpack DevDependency recognizes and transpiles svg to render properly.
