2. [Requirements](#requirements)

## Usage

1. run `npm install` to install dependencies.
2. run `npm run viewerSeed` to seed database.
3. run `npm run build` to run webpack.
4. run `npm start` to start server.

Note: due to Amazon S3 service's fetch limit. I had to refactor my code to display fake image using another method than S3. This is why only one picture shows up when database is seeded.

## Requirements

- Node 6.13.0
- Mongo Shell (OPTIONAL, but helps)

## Acknowledgements

I would like to thank my team members from G.O.A.T. Yoga for all the fun times and the trials and tribulations that we faced together.
